        Author: <i>Elena Armas</i>> is a Spanish writer, a self confessed hopeless romantic and a proud book hoarder.
        Now, she's also the author of
        International bestseller and soon to be adapted to film The Spanish Love Deception; and instant New York Times
        bestseller The American Roommate Experiment. Her books will soon be translated to 32 languages–which is
        absolutely
        bananas, if you ask her.

        She hopes her stories make your heart skip a beat or two, your palms a little sweaty, and your cheeks flush in
        that rosy
        pink that makes other people want to peek at the page you are reading.

        SUMMARY:Catalina Martín desperately needs a date to her sister’s wedding. Especially since her little white lie
        about her
        American boyfriend has spiralled out of control. Now everyone she knows—including her ex and his fiancée—will be
        there
        and eager to meet him.<br><br>

        She only has four weeks to find someone willing to cross the Atlantic and aid in her deception. New York to
        Spain is no
        short flight and her raucous family won’t be easy to fool.<br><br>

        Enter Aaron Blackford—her tall, handsome, condescending colleague—who surprisingly offers to step in. She’d
        rather
        refuse; never has there been a more aggravating, blood-boiling, and insufferable man.

        But Catalina is desperate, and as the wedding draws nearer, Aaron looks like her best option. And she begins to
        realize
        he might not be as terrible in the real world as he is at the office.<br><br>
