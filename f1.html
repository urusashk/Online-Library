        <u>SUMMARY:</u>When nineteen-year-old huntress Feyre kills a wolf in the woods, a terrifying creature arrives to
        demand
        retribution.
        Dragged to a treacherous magical land she knows about only from legends, Feyre discovers that her captor is not
        truly a
        beast, but one of the lethal, immortal faeries who once ruled her world.<br><br>

        At least, he’s not a beast all the time.
        <br>
        As she adapts to her new home, her feelings for the faerie, Tamlin, transform from icy hostility into a fiery
        passion
        that burns through every lie she’s been told about the beautiful, dangerous world of the Fae. But something is
        not right
        in the faerie lands. An ancient, wicked shadow is growing, and Feyre must find a way to stop it, or doom
        Tamlin—and his
        world—forever.
        <br><br>
        From bestselling author Sarah J. Maas comes a seductive, breathtaking book that blends romance, adventure, and
        faerie
        lore into an unforgettable read.
